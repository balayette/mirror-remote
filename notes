The server receives webhooks from github.
The server has to pull the repo if the local version is odler than the remote
version.

Filesystem :

host
|--->username
     |--->repos
|--->username2
     |--->repos

The host part is irrelevant for now because only github is supported.

Flowchart :

Read the config file, open repos / clone

config file format :

store=path
repo=...
repo=...
repo=...
end

end is not mandatory, but acts as a delimiter. Everything after it isn't read
Comments with #


Receive a webhook for repo username/repo.
if host/username doesn't exist, create it
if host/username/repo doesn't exist, clone in host/username
if host/username/repo is >= than the webhook, do nothing
else pull
